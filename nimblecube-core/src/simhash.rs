//! SimHash: random-hyperplane projection of a dense vector into an `Hv`.
//!
//! Complements `FeatureEncoder`, which encodes quantized sensor channels. This
//! encodes a dense vector (an embedding) so that Hamming distance in the `Hv`
//! tracks the angle between the inputs:
//!
//! ```text
//! P[bit differs] = theta / pi
//! ```
//!
//! so at 4096 bits identical inputs give 0, orthogonal inputs give ~2048, and a
//! cosine of 0.9 gives ~590. That is the same normalization `Hv::similarity`
//! already uses (0.5 = orthogonal), so projected vectors drop straight into
//! `FixedStore` and the IVF index without any further scaling.
//!
//! Hyperplanes are never stored. Each output bit derives its own sign pattern
//! from `seed` and the bit index, so encoding costs no RAM beyond the output:
//! 4096 explicit hyperplanes over a 768-dim input would be about 12 MB, which
//! no target here has. Signs are +/-1 (Rademacher) rather than Gaussian, which
//! keeps the projection to adds and subtracts and preserves the angle law.
//!
//! Same `seed` always yields the same code, so a store enrolled with one seed
//! must be queried with it.
